LAMPSTER
========

An extremely simple LIFX control app for OS X, which lets you turn all your
bulbs on or off with one click (or keypress). It can be brought to foreground
at any time by pressing Shift-âŒ˜-L, and the keys 1/0 can be used for the On/Off
buttons, respectively.

It is the result of a couple of evenings of hacking to try embedding a Ruby
helper program and communicating with it using stdio and as such is has a bunch
of bugs - most notably it lacks a lot of error handling and may hang or crash
if the network connection is down or unreliable.
