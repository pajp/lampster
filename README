An extremely simple LIFX control app for OS X, which lets you control the power
of individual bulbs or change the power or colour of all bulbs at once.

It can be brought forward through the hot key ⇧⌘L. You can also toggle bulbs
through a Dock menu.

It is the result of a couple of evenings of hacking to try embedding a Ruby
helper program and communicating with it using stdio and as such is has a bunch
of bugs - most notably it lacks a lot of error handling and may hang or crash
if the network connection is down or unreliable. 

The LIFX client parts are synchronous in that all LIFX commands are issued on a
serial queue and there can only be one outstanding request at the time, but the
API is asynchronous and block based.

To build, you need to "git submodule init && git submodule update" and change
the code signing build settings.
